    <h1> Hello! I'm Jan Heikkil√§ and welcome to my web page! </h1>
    <p> This here web page you've stumbled across is made for a course project, so the content might seem a bit random, 
      but I'll do my best to make it as comprehensible as possible.
     So! I'm a finnish game developer student at Kajaani university of applied sciences. 
      As of the creation of this page I'm 20 years old. The areas of game development 
      that I want to specialize in are gameplay and narrative design. </p>
