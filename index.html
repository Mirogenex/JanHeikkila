    <p> This here web page you've stumbled across is made for a course project, so the content might seem a bit random, 
    but I'll try my best to make it as comprehensible as possible. <br>
    So!<br>
    I'm a finnish game developer student at Kajaani university of applied sciences. 
    As of the creation of this page I'm 20 years old.<br>
    The areas of game development 
    that I want to specialise in are gameplay and narrative design.<br>  
    Games have always been a big part of my life, so i wanted to keep that going throughout my adult life as well. 
    As such I wanted to make games for a living. </p>
    </div>
